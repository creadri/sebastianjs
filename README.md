# SebastainJS

SebastianJS is a mermaid wrapper designed to make it able to perform server-side svg renderers without needing a headless browser.

## Goal

Use default mermaidjs implementation, this is not a fork. It is designed to remain a wrapper.

Re-implementation of render methods in order to avoid the need of browser full dom support.

Focus is made on implementing SVG exports.

## Roadmap

[ ] Make structure of render method
[ ] Implement tests for all known mermaidjs diagrams (excluding beta ones)
[ ] Make first render implementation with minimal DOM support for basic flowchart
[ ] Extend render support by resolving test issues.
[ ] Release First viable option
